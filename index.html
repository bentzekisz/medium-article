    <h2>you should think about...</h2>
    <p>
      Life somethimes can be a bitch but don't worry. If you're being each time bit more awful than yesterday you can still be a happy one.
    </p>

    <h2>If you feel sad, just don't be sad!</h2>
    </h2>
    <p>
      You just have to shout 3 times in a mirror that <b>"Not today Satan, not today!"</b> and turn 25 times around vertically, at the end you maybe have to sacrifice a goat but basically that's it. You will feel like a brand new person after that.

    <h2>A final verdict</h2>
    <p>
      I don't know if you are ready to hear this but maybe you should go visit a doctor. Maybe they can put you in a mental insitution. <b>REMEMBER:</b> The food is free there. Have fun boo!
